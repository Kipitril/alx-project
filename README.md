Introduction
Ignite provides real-time insights into your energy consumption, helps you track usage patterns, and suggests actions to reduce energy waste. The app integrates with smart devices and IoT systems, enabling users to control appliances remotely and receive recommendations for optimizing their home or business energy footprint.

Features
Real-Time Monitoring: Monitor energy consumption in real-time.
Usage History: View historical data of energy consumption for a week, month, or year.
Smart Alerts: Receive notifications and alerts on excessive usage or energy-saving tips.
Cost Estimation: Calculate potential costs and savings based on current usage.
Remote Control: Control connected IoT devices (e.g., lights, thermostats) remotely.
Energy Efficiency Tips: Get personalized recommendations to improve energy efficiency.
Reports: Generate usage reports that show trends and cost breakdowns.
Technologies Used
Frontend:
React (for web-based UI)
React Native (for mobile app)
Redux (state management)
Tailwind CSS (for styling)
Chart.js (for displaying energy usage data)
Backend:
Node.js (for server-side logic)
Express.js (for API routing)
MongoDB (database for storing user data and energy consumption history)
Firebase Authentication (for user login and account management)
IoT Integration:
Arduino (for interfacing with smart meters or devices)
Wi-Fi module (for communication between IoT devices and the app)
Cloud Services:
Firebase (for real-time database and notifications)
AWS (for hosting the app, if applicable)
Deployment:
Heroku (for backend deployment)
Vercel (for frontend deployment)
System Architecture
The Ignite app is built using a client-server model with integration to IoT devices. The system is divided into three main layers:

Frontend (Mobile/Web): The user-facing interface where users can monitor energy usage, control appliances, and view reports.
Backend (Server): Handles authentication, API requests, and communication between the frontend and IoT devices.
IoT Layer: The physical devices (e.g., smart meters, smart plugs) connected to the app, allowing users to control and monitor energy consumption.
